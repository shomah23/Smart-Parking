# INTRODUCTION
The parking system can park the most cars possible by fully utilizing
the available space. And so, after naming the various problems that arise from looking for
parking spots, they have been wondering How can this problem be fixed? The answer is Smart
Parking. Smart Parking is a parking solution, with cameras, or counting sensors. These devices
are usually embedded into parking spots or positioned next to them to detect whether parking
bays are free or occupied. What are we trying to achieve with smart parking is to save time and
try to provide high-security service, and to do so our system will contain RFID and sensors,
whereby RFID our system will provide security and by using the sensor we can manage the
organization.
# Advantage for using Smart Parking

* Cost and Time Efficient Solution

Drivers may be able to save time and money by using smart parking solutions. This is due to the fact that the drivers spent a considerable amount of time looking for a parking space before entering the crowded parking lot. When the drivers are unable to get at the intended location in a timely manner, this eventually wastes their time and frustrates them.

* Reduce Parking Stress

The goal of smart parking solutions is to relieve drivers' tension when they are parking. The divers can use smart parking applications to find out whether there are any parking spots nearby where they wish to go. This lessens the uncertainty and stress involved with locating a suitable parking space close to the target location.

* Reduce Search Traffic on Streets

Smart parking technologies make sure there are fewer automobiles driving around in circles trying to find a parking space. In the end, this improves traffic flow and attempts to reduce as little as possible the amount of search traffic on the streets.
